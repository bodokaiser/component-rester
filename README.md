# component-rester

Your sweet REST client based on superagent.

## Usage

    var rester = require('rester');

    var client = rester('/products');

    client.on('error', function(error) {
      // handle error in application or view
    });
    client.on('find', function(models) {
      // render models in view
    });
    // will do a GET /products?filter[name]=Bag
    client.find({ filter: { name: 'Bag' } });

    // or directly with callback
    client.find({ filter: { name: 'Bag' } }, function(err, res) {
      if (err) throw err;

      // else handle response
    });


## Install

Preferable with [component](https://github.com/component/component)

    $ component install bodokaiser/component-rester

*npm, browserify support would be not to hard to achieve - patches welcome.*

## Documentation

The exposed function behind `rester` is a factory which will instance the
`Rester` prototype for you. The `Rester` prototype does nothing more then
to add some REST API sugar on superagent. Also by using the reset function
to create instances of `Rester` you can centralize error management and setup
plugins.

### rester(url[, options])

Will return an instance of `Rester` which will be bound to specified `url`.
This means that all requests will be prefixed to the `url`.

The `options` parameter is currently undefined. We may use it in future.

### Event: "error"

    rester.on('error', function(error) {
      // lets do it the easy way
      throw error;
    });

Will be emitted each time a superagent error occurs (e.g. "network error").

Intended for centralized error management. For example you could shutdown your
application on an error or render an error message through notifications
however you are not forced to do this out of each single request.

### Event: "status"

    rester.on('status', function(status, body, res) {
      if (status === 400) return view.notify('There was an error in your data.');
    });

Will be emitted for special status handling.

As for example a `bad request` response is not an error per definition (mostly
it is a validation error) superagent handles them as success. However you
may want to bind to specific 4xx statuses by subscribing to this event.

### rester.use(plugin)

    rester.use(function(request) {
      request.set('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + sesstionStorage.get('token'));
    });

Will register a plugin on each `Rester` instance. A plugin basically appends
logic to the superagents `request` before `request.end` is called. You can
use it for authentorization (e.g. JSON-Web-Tokens) or more.

#### client

Following methods are only available on direct `Rester` instances not on the
global namespace.

#### client.find([query, callback])

    // does a GET /<endpoint>
    client.find(function(ok, body, response) {
      if (!ok) return;

      // use body
    });

    // does a GET /<endpoint>?limit=10
    client.find({ limit: 10 }, function(ok, body, response) {
      if (!ok) return;

      // use body
    });

Will do a `GET` request against the specified endpoint where optional `query`
is used as query string parameter and the optional `callback` executed on
success (non-error) else it will emit a `find` event.

#### client.findOne(query[, callback])

    // does a GET /<endpoint>/123?include=true
    client.findOne({ id: 123, include: true });

    // does a GET /<endpoint>/123
    client.findOne(123);

Will do a `GET` request against the subresource of the specified endpoint. The
subresource is either the `id` property of the `query` hash or if `query` is a
string or number then this. If you do not provide a `callback` a `findOne`
event is emitted.

#### client.persist(model[, callback])

    // does a POST /<endpoint>
    client.persist({ name: 'Joe' });

    // does a PUT /<endpoint>/<model.id>
    client.persist({ id: 123, name: 'Joe' });

Either does a `POST` request if no `id` is present in the provided `model` or
a `PUT` if so. If you provide no `callback` you can listen to the `persist`
event.

#### client.destroy(model[, callback])

    // does a DELETE /<endpoint>/123
    client.destroy({ id: 123 });

    // also does a DELETE /<endpoint/123
    client.destroy('123');

Will send a `DELETE` request to a subresource on endpoint. It will either use
the `id` property of `model` or it will just use `model` if string or number.
Emits a `destroy` event if no `callback` provided.
